# Renderer

### It is a little experiment to repruduce some basic implementation of a virtual dom.

___


It's a very naive setup for a one directional flow based render script which uses vdom.

It has some state, shich is only good to display innerHTML. It's main feautre is that adding elements and modifying their state can be done through a seperate API in a one directional flow.
